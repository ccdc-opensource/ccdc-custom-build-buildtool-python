# Introduction 
This repository contains scripts used to generate a clean python distribution for use in build machines.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DISTRIBUTE THESE DISTRIBUTIONS OUTSIDE CCDC!

They will only work in the build machines, in the path where they should be installed.

Madness lies outside that path. Conda is one answer. Using platform specific package managers is another.

This is not the answer. It is just a way to get a stable package into the build machines.
