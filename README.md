# Introduction 
This repository contains scripts used to generate a clean python distribution for use in buildtool.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DISTRIBUTE THESE DISTRIBUTIONS OUTSIDE CCDC!

DO NOT USE THESE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR API CODE!

They will only work in the build machines, for buildtool, in the path where they should be installed.

If you use it for anything other than buildtool, you are the problem.

## What is different from ccdc-build-python

- The python version
- There's zero support for tcl/tk.
- Some pip packages are installed. Therefore you can't move the distribution from it's intended path.
